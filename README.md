# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning classification models to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation using four different algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) which contains 14 attributes related to patient health and heart condition.

Make sure to include the dataset file (e.g., `heart.csv`) in the same repository.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
